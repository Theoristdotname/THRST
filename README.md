# **THEORIST**

**What is THEORIST. It is everything you’ve never wanted, wrapped in nothing you’ll ever need.**

---

###  Overview

THEORIST is not a repository; it’s a quantum thought experiment disguised as a GitHub repo. This is a space where files might exist, but their relevance is a mirage. You don’t find meaning here—meaning finds you, then promptly forgets why it came.

Prepare to embrace the theoretical. Confront the unnecessary. Marvel at the ineffable code of nothingness.

### Structure (or Lack Thereof)

Below is an outline of the repository—but don’t be deceived by its apparent simplicity. Every directory is a Möbius strip of recursion and confusion:

- `/essence/`
  - **README.md**: A README that describes the README describing itself.
  - **ontologicalvoid.txt**: Contents: `\The contents of this file do not exist.\`

- `/void/`
  - **README.md**: Explores the philosophical vacuum within the directory. You’ll never read it the same way twice.
  - **empty/empty/empty.txt**: A nested folder hierarchy leading to... nothing.

- `/meta/`
  - **README.md**: Discusses metadata as a metaphor for human futility.
  - **meta-about-meta.md**: A meta-discussion about discussions that might have been.

- **manifesto.txt**: A text file that simply says: `This space intentionally left blank.`

- **paradox.json**: A JSON file containing:
  ```json
  {
    "truth": "undefined",
    "lies": "potentially true",
    "mystery": ["unsolvable", "unfathomable"]
  }
  ```

###  Usage

Using THEORIST is an experience in embracing the void. There is no utility, but there’s plenty of potential for existential dread:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourname/theorist
$ cd theorist/meta
$ cat meta-about-meta.md
# File not found
```

#### For Power Users:

To fully utilize THEORIST, try running commands that simulate its ethos:

```bash
$ mkdir nothing && cd nothing
$ echo "Is this file real?" > maybe.txt
$ rm maybe.txt && ls
# (empty, as it should be)
```

###  Contribution

Contributing to THEORIST is a paradoxical act. Follow these rules:

1. **Do Nothing:** Submit pull requests that don’t change a line of code.
2. **Speak in Riddles:** All issue titles must be written as haikus, anagrams, or cryptic philosophical inquiries.
3. **Be Everywhere, Nowhere:** Contributions will only be accepted if they simultaneously exist and don’t.

Example contribution:

```bash
Issue: "Does 0 divide the infinite?"
```

### Disclaimer

The creators of THEORIST are not liable for:

- Recursive loops of contemplation
- Files disappearing into a conceptual void
- Realizations of the absurdity of existence

By engaging with THEORIST, you agree to be bound by its non-binding terms of non-engagement.

### Final Thoughts

THEORIST challenges you to let go of logic. In a universe full of utilitarian software, be the repository that does absolutely nothing. Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon sought to make machines think—we invite you to do the opposite. Forget, unlearn, and bask in the glory of theoretical absurdity.

Welcome to the void. Proceed sideways.
